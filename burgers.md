roughly what I remember we did


### Ingredients

 * 1 can black beans
 * 1 can chickpeas
 * 1 decent-sized carrot, shredded with a cheese grater (long strands are good)
 * 1/3 cup whole wheat flour
 * 2 tbsp ground psyllium husk
 * 1/2 one of those small cans of tomato paste
 * 2 small onions
 * 1 good cup chopped parsley
 * 1 lime, juiced (protip courtesy of ATG: cut length-wise for optimal juicing)
 * 1/2 cup crimini mushrooms, chopped pretty small and fried to drive off moisture.
 * salt... maybe 1.5 tsp?
 * 1/4 walnuts, in small pieces
 * 2/3 cup pecan pieces
 * 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar


### directions

1. mash all the beans together in a large bowl

2. saute the onions and add lots of spices (bit of cinnamon, some coriander, chili powder, curry powder, ...).

3. mix everything together in the bowl and let it rest for 5 minutes

4. form into patties. we made 14.

5. fry em up! we use a panini press, and cook until they become browned on the outside. they could also be fried in a little oil and then baked. bbq would be tricky but probably doable.


### general veggie burger notes

 * The beans, carrot, flour, psyllium husk, and tomato paste all help bind the burgers together. Good substitutions:
    - bread crumbs (you can add lots to stretch the recipe to make more burgers, but with more than maybe 1/2 cup they will be a little less hearty. they might need more liquid, and they definitely need the resting time)
    - ground flax seeds: mix 2 tbsp ground flax with 6 tbsp warm/hot water, let soak for 5 mins, and then add. great binder (could replace psyllium husk)
    - chia seeds instead of flax. they can go straight in.
    - 2 eggs, if you want to be less cool.
 * All of the other ingredients are optional and swap-able, and you can add whatever you want. Just keep things in small pieces.
